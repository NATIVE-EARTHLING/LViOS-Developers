/// The definition of a 'Resstaurant' object as defined by the JSON file. Its extremely simple for sample purposes but you can see how it works. The key to making this data usable
/// by SwiftUI is that the class adopts the `Identifiable` protocol which requires a unique identifier vai the `id` property. The rest of the data is specific to our application.
